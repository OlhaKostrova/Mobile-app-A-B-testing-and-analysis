This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a redesigned subscription onboarding screen in improving key metrics through A/B testing.
Hypotheses were formulated to test whether the new design improves subscription conversion rates, ARPU, and user engagement. The target audience was segmented, and metrics were defined to measure success. The required sample size and test duration were calculated. Results were analyzed, revealing statistically significant insights to guide decision-making.
