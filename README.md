This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a redesigned subscription onboarding screen in improving key metrics through A/B testing.
Hypotheses were formulated to test whether the new design improves subscription conversion rates, ARPU, and user engagement. The target audience was segmented, and metrics were defined to measure success. 
The required sample size and test duration were calculated. Results were analyzed, revealing statistically significant insights to guide decision-making.

- The test conditions:

In our mobile app, after onboarding, users are offered a weekly subscription for $4.99, which gives them access to premium features. Currently, 17% of users who receive the offer purchase a subscription on this screen.
We decided to test an alternative design of the subscription screen, where we also offer a $4.99 subscription, but tell the user that it is 50% off.
Every day, about 2 thousand users install the app, and 34% of users reach the subscription screen.
